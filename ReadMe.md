# Concierge
## Cooper Standard, 2023


This is an api middleware for interfacing with a mongodb instance written with nodejs, express, and mongoose. Concierge served as the backend for a reactjs frontend built by some of my classmates.
Concierge is a restful api that handles posting new content, patching existing content, getting content that match queries on specific fields, creating user accounts,
user sessions, authenticating access, and more. `Enpoints.pdf` in Concierge's root directory has a more in depth description of the user facing functionality. Although not
available in this version because of privacy, the deployed version of Concierge was also able to send and recieve email through the mailgun api.
